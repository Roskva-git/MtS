## Abstract
 Psychological sciences have identified a wealth of cognitive processes and behavioral phenomena, yet struggle to produce cumulative knowledge. Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of multifaceted constructs like self-regulation. Here, we derive a psychological ontology from a study of individual differences across a broad range of
 behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and self-reported real-world outcomes associated with self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show
 little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology identifies reli
able individual traits and reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis. We then evaluate
 predictive power of the psychological measurements and find that while surveys modestly
 and heterogeneously predict real-world outcomes, tasks largely do not. We conclude that
 self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct, and that data-driven ontologies lay the
 groundwork for a cumulative psychological science.
