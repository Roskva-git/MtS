  abstract = {Response inhibition, the intentional stopping of planned or initiated actions, is often considered a key facet of control, impulsivity, and self-regulation. The stop signal task is argued to be the purest inhibition task we have, and it is thus central to much work investigating the role of inhibition in areas like development and psychopathology. Most of this work quantifies stopping behavior by calculating the stop signal reaction time as a measure of individual stopping latency. Individual difference studies aiming to investigate why and how stopping latencies differ between people often do this under the assumption that the stop signal reaction time indexes a stable, dispositional trait. However, empirical support for this assumption is lacking, as common measures of inhibition and control tend to show low test-retest reliability and thus appear unstable over time. The reasons for this could be methodological, where low stability is driven by measurement noise, or substantive, where low stability is driven by a larger influence of state-like and situational factors. To investigate this, we characterized the split-half and test-retest reliability of a range of common behavioral and electrophysiological measures derived from the stop signal task. Across three independent studies, different measurement modalities, and a systematic review of the literature, we found a pattern of low temporal stability for inhibition measures and higher stability for measures of manifest behavior and non-inhibitory processing. This pattern could not be explained by measurement noise and low internal consistency. Consequently, response inhibition appears to have mostly state-like and situational determinants, and there is little support for the validity of conceptualizing common inhibition measures as reflecting stable traits.},

Although sleep deprivation has long been known to negatively affect cognitive performance, the exact mechanisms through which it acts and what cognitive domains are affected most is still disputed. The current study provides a theory-driven approach to examine and explain the detrimental effects of sleep loss with a focus on attention and cognitive control.
Methods

Twenty-four participants (12 females; age: 24 ± 3 years) completed the experiment that involved laboratory-controlled over-night sleep deprivation and two control conditions, namely, a normally rested night at home and a night of sleep in the laboratory. Using a stop signal task in combination with electroencephalographic recordings, we dissociated different processes contributing to task performance such as sustained attention, automatic or bottom-up processing, and strategic or top-down control. At the behavioral level, we extracted reaction times, response accuracy, and markers of behavioral adjustments (post-error and post-stop slowing), whereas at the neural level event-related potentials (ERP) found in context of response inhibition (N2/P3) and error monitoring (ERN/Pe) were obtained.
Results

It was found that 24 hr of sleep deprivation resulted in declined sustained attention and reduced P300 and Pe amplitudes, demonstrating a gradual breakdown of top-down control. In contrast, N200 and ERN as well as the stop-signal reaction time showed higher resilience to sleep loss signifying the role of automatic processing.
Conclusions

These results support the notion that sleep deprivation is more detrimental to cognitive functions that are relatively more dependent on mental effort and/or cognitive capacity, as opposed to more automatic control processes.},

N = 150 participants carried out antisaccade, Eriksen flanker, go/nogo, Simon, stop-signal, and Stroop tasks on three occasions. By applying latent state-trait modeling and latent growth-curve modeling, reliability was estimated and divided into the amount of variance explained by trait effects and trait changes (consistency) and the amount of variance explained by situational effects and effects of Situation × Person interaction (occasion specificity). Mean reaction times for all tasks revealed excellent reliabilities (.89-.99). Importantly, on average, 82\% of variance was accounted for by consistency while specificity was rather small. Although primary inhibitory variables revealed lower reliabilities (.51-.85), the majority of explained variance was again trait determined. Trait changes were observed for most variables and were strongest when comparing the first occasion to later ones. In addition, in some variables, those improvements were particularly high in initially underperforming subjects. An analysis of the construct of inhibition on trait level showed that communality between tasks was low. We conclude that most variables in inhibitory control tasks are mainly affected by stable trait effects, but there is only little evidence of a common, underlying inhibitory control construct at trait level.

Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression.

Results: Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen's d effect sizes ranging from -0.34 to -0.65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen's d ranging from -0.52 to -0.61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen's d ranging from -0.22 to -0.54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression.

Conclusions: Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each play an important role in improving outcome for patients with depression. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that cognitive impairment represents a core feature of depression that cannot be considered an epiphenomenon that is entirely secondary to symptoms of low mood and that may be a valuable target for future interventions},

Participants representative of the general population who had never had MDD completed sleep questionnaires (n = 2000) and/or underwent PSG (n = 717). Over 8 years' follow-up, participants completed psychiatric interviews enabling the diagnosis of MDD. Survival Cox models were used to analyze associations between sleep features and MDD incidence. A higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale and presence of insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with a higher incidence of MDD (hazard ratio [HR] [95 \% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.062 [1.022-1.103], p = 0.002 and 1.437 [1.064-1.940], p = 0.018, respectively).

If the stopping process wins, thought and action are inhibited; if the ongoing process wins, thought and action run on to completion. The theory is formally developed to account for many aspects of performance in situations with explicit stop signals, and it is applied to data obtained from 3 adult observers in a series of RT tasks.

    Methods: In 147 community-dwelling adults (92 female; age 53.9 +/- 15.5 years), sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and correlated with cross-sectional measures of volume and longitudinal measures of atrophy derived from MRI scans separated by an average of 3.5 years. Exploratory post hoc analysis compared correlations between different age groups and included physical activity, BMI, and blood pressure as additional covariates.
    Results: Poor sleep quality was associated with reduced volume within the right superior frontal cortex in cross-sectional analyses, and an increased rate of atrophy within widespread frontal, temporal, and parietal regions in longitudinal analyses. Results were largely driven by correlations within adults over the age of 60, and could not be explained by variation in physical activity, BMI, or blood pressure. Sleep quality was not associated with hippocampal volume or atrophy.
    Conclusions: We found that longitudinal measures of cortical atrophy were widely correlated with sleep quality. Poor sleep quality may be a cause or a consequence of brain atrophy, and future studies examining the effect of interventions that improve sleep quality on rates of atrophy may hold key insights into the direction of this relationship.},

To investigate whether sleep disturbances are bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and thus identify potential risk factors for each problem.

Design:
A systematic review was conducted on 9 studies (8 longitudinal, 1 retrospective) that assessed bidirectionality between a sleep disturbance, and anxiety or depression. Treatment studies were excluded, along with those solely based on clinical samples or cohorts at high risk of suffering from a sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases, and reference lists of eligible studies. Publication dates ranged from the beginning of each database to December 2011.

Measurements and Results:
Syntheses of longitudinal studies suggested insomnia and sleep quality were bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and depression/anxiety, respectively. Childhood sleep problems significantly predicted higher levels of depression and a combined depression/anxiety variable, but not vice-versa. A one-way relationship was found where anxiety predicted excessive daytime sleepiness, but excessive daytime sleepiness was not associated with depression.

Conclusions:
Definitive conclusions regarding bidirectionality cannot be made for most sleep disturbances due to the small number and heterogeneity of cohort samples used across studies. Nevertheless, best available evidence suggests insomnia is bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective 
Depression and insomnia are closely linked, yet our understanding of their prospective relationships remains limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate the directionality of association between depression and insomnia.

Methods 
Data were collected from a prospective population-based study comprising the most recent waves of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) (the HUNT2 in 1995–1997 and the HUNT3 in 2006–2008). A total of 24,715 persons provided valid responses on the relevant questionnaires from both surveys. Study outcomes were onset of depression or insomnia at HUNT3 in persons not reporting the other disorder in HUNT2.

Results 
Both insomnia and depression significantly predicted the onset of the other disorder. Participants who did not have depression in HUNT2 but who had insomnia in both HUNT2 and HUNT3 had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.2 of developing depression at HUNT3. Participants who did not have insomnia in HUNT2 but who had depression in both HUNT2 and HUNT3 had an OR of 6.7 of developing insomnia at HUNT3. ORs were only slightly attenuated when adjusting for potential confounding factors.

Conclusions 
The results support a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression. This finding stands in contrast to the previous studies, which have mainly focused on insomnia as a risk factor for the onset of depression.},

Our daily circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycle allow us to function optimally in a dynamic world, adjusting our biology to the demands imposed by the day/night cycle. The themes developed in this review focus upon the growing realization that we ignore the circadian and sleep systems at our peril, and this paper considers the mechanisms that generate and regulate circadian and sleep systems; what happens mechanistically when these systems collapse as a result of societal pressures and disease; how sleep disruption and stress are linked; why sleep disruption and mental illness invariably occur together; and how individuals and employers can attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with working against our internal temporal biology. While some of the health costs of sleep disruption can be reduced, in the short-term at least, there will always be significant negative consequences associated with shift work and sleep loss. With this in mind, society needs to address this issue and decide when the consequences of sleep disruption are justified in the workplace.},

We discuss the functions of sleep and highlight the paradoxical implications of theories seeing sleep as an adaptive capacity versus the theory that sleep benefits clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. We also evaluate the proposition that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of memories. Finally, we review research on possible effects of chronic sleep deprivation on brain health. We find that the evidence for a causal role of sleep in human brain health is surprisingly weak relative to the amount of attention to sleep in science and society. While there are well-established associations between sleep parameters and aspects of brain health, results are generally not consistent across studies and measures, and it is not clear to what extent alterations in sleep patterns represent symptoms or causes. Especially, the proposition that long sleep (>8 hours) in general is beneficial for long-term brain health in humans seems to lack empirical support. We suggest directions for future research to establish a solid foundation of knowledge about a role of sleep in brain health based on longitudinal studies with frequent sampling, attention to individual differences, and more ecologically valid intervention studies.},

Poor memory and increased risk of dementia is associated with the extremes of sleep quantity and disruption of other sleep characteristics. We examined sleep and cognitive data from the UK Biobank (N = 479,420) in middle-to-late life healthy individuals (age 38–73 years) and the relationship with brain structure in a sub-group (N = 37,553). Seven hours of sleep per day was associated with the highest cognitive performance which decreased for every hour below and above this sleep duration. This quadratic relationship remained present in older individuals (>60 years, N = 212,006). Individuals who sleep between six-to-eight hours had significantly greater grey matter volume in 46 of 139 different brain regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampi, precentral gyrus, right frontal pole and cerebellar subfields. Several brain regions showed a quadratic relationship between sleep duration and volume while other regions were smaller only in individuals who slept longer. These findings highlight the important relationship between the modifiable lifestyle factor of sleep duration and cognition as well as a widespread association between sleep and structural brain health.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review
To review the literature examining the relationship between sleep and cognition, specifically examining the sub-domain of executive function. We explore the impact of sleep deprivation and the important question of how much sleep is required for optimal cognitive performance. We consider how other sleep metrics, such as sleep quality, may be a more meaningful measure of sleep. We then discuss the putative mechanisms between sleep and cognition followed by their contribution to developing dementia.

Recent Findings
Sleep duration and executive function display a quadratic relationship. This suggests an optimal amount of sleep is required for daily cognitive processes. Poor sleep efficiency and sleep fragmentation are linked with poorer executive function and increased risk of dementia during follow-up. Sleep quality may therefore be more important than absolute duration. Biological mechanisms which may underpin the relationship between sleep and cognition include brain structural and functional changes as well as disruption of the glymphatic system.

Summary
Sleep is an important modifiable lifestyle factor to improve daily cognition and, possibly, reduce the risk of developing dementia. The impact of optimal sleep duration and sleep quality may have important implications for every ageing individual.},

Here we argue that experimentally restricted sleep is not a good model for understanding the normal functions of sleep in naturalistic settings. Cross-disciplinary research suggests that human sleep is remarkably dependent on environmental conditions and social norms, thus escaping universally applicable rules. Sleep need varies over time and differs between individuals, showing a complex relationship with neurocognitive function. This aspect of sleep is rarely addressed in experimental work and is not reflected in expert recommendations about sleep duration. We recommend focusing on the role of individual and environmental factors to improve our understanding of the relationship between human sleep and cognition.},

In this Perspective, I integrate these literatures to derive a cognitive architecture and functional rules underlying the regulation of cognitive stability and flexibility. I propose that task focus and task switch readiness are supported by independent mechanisms. However, I also suggest that the strategic regulation of both mechanisms is governed by shared learning principles: an incremental, online learner that nudges control up or down based on the recent history of task demands (a recency heuristic) and episodic reinstatement when the current context matches a past experience (a recognition heuristic). Finally, I discuss algorithmic and neural implementations of these processes, as well as clinical implications.},

Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This ‘switch cost’ is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of ‘task-set’ activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate ‘controlling’ from ‘controlled’ regions},

The current review provides an overview of recent research on both topics. First, we review different experimental approaches to task switching, such as comparing mixed-task blocks with single-task blocks, predictable task-switching and task-cuing paradigms, intermittent instructions, and voluntary task selection. In the 2nd part, we discuss findings on preparatory control mechanisms in task switching and theoretical accounts of task preparation. We consider preparation processes in two-stage models, consider preparation as an all-or-none process, address the question of whether preparation is switch-specific, reflect on preparation as interaction of cue encoding and memory retrieval, and discuss the impact of verbal mediation on preparation. In the 3rd part, we turn to interference phenomena in task switching. We consider proactive interference of tasks and inhibition of recently performed tasks indicated by asymmetrical switch costs and n-2 task-repetition costs. We discuss stimulus-based interference as a result of stimulus-based response activation and stimulus-based task activation, and response-based interference because of applying bivalent rather than univalent responses, response repetition effects, and carryover of response selection and execution. In the 4th and final part, we mention possible future research fields.},

Given that sleep affects executive function, age-related changes in executive function may be attributable to changes in sleep. The present study used a sleep detection device to examine whether or not wake time after sleep onset and total sleep time moderated age differences in task-switching performance and participants ability to reduce switch costs when given time to prepare. Participants were cognitively healthy (Mini Mental State Examination > 26) younger (n = 54; mean age = 22.9; 67.8\% female) and older (n = 45; mean age 62.8; 71.1\% female) adults. Using a task-switching paradigm, which manipulated preparation time, we found that smaller global switch costs were associated with lower wake time after sleep onset and longer total sleep time. Greater preparation effects on local switch costs and adoption of a task-set were associated with lower wake time after sleep onset, although this effect was significant only in older adults when stratified by age group. This association was independent of inhibition and working memory abilities. The lack of interactions between sleep and age group indicated that age differences in switch costs were not moderated by better sleep. Our results suggest that young and older adults may benefit similarly from lower wake time after sleep onset and longer total sleep time in overall performance, and individuals with less wake time after sleep onset are more likely to engage preparatory strategies to reduce switch costs and boost task-switching performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Executive function and psychomotor speed are consistently impaired in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Persistent cognitive impairments after depression remission are thought to reflect 'scarring' from the neurotoxic effects of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity during a depressive episode. As sleep also deteriorates with depression and restores daytime executive functions, we examined whether adequate sleep could be protective against task-switching and psychomotor impairments associated with a history of MDD.

Methods: This cross-sectional study tested task-switching associations with MDD history, sleep, and their interaction to determine whether sleep continuity and sleep duration moderate the relationship between MDD history and task-switching performance.

Results: After adjusting for age, sex, education, current depressive symptoms, and use of anti-depressants, a history of MDD, particularly recurrent MDD, was associated with slower response speed and disproportionately lower accuracy on repetition trials compared to switch trials, reflecting impaired adoption of a task-set. Regardless of MDD history, higher wake after sleep onset and shorter total sleep time were associated with slower response times, but neither sleep measure moderated the association between depression history and task-switching performance.

Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot assess the causal direction of associations. One night of sleep in the laboratory was used to assess sleep and a single task-switching paradigm was used to assess executive function.

Conclusions: These results suggest that longer, more continuous sleep is associated with greater psychomotor speed across healthy controls and those with a history of MDD, but MDD-task-switching associations are not mitigated by longer or more continuous sleep.},

  abstract = {Driving is a complex activity, entailing concurrent preparation and execution of motor behavior, and processing of cognitive information. Dual-tasking often leads to performance decrements, especially when the subtasks require similar neural resources, e.g., controlling the steering wheel, handling the pedals and shifting gears. With higher age, the ability to simultaneously perform different tasks deteriorates, as more mental resources are required for accurate coordination of movements. Therefore, using electroencephalography, we measured the neural correlates of dual-task driving in 81 healthy younger (n = 27), middle-aged (n = 25) and older adults (n = 29). A visuocognitive and a visuomotor dual-task were combined with a simulated lane-keeping task, with the latter dual-task requiring more similar resources. As expected, steering precision decreased to a higher extent when combined with a visuomotor dual-task in all participants, compared to no deterioration in the visuocognitive dual-task. Yet, this visuomotor dual-task performance decrease was more prominent with increasing age. Remarkably, although mid-frontal theta power increased in all groups when a visuomotor dual-task was added, indicating the recruitment of additional mental resources, this increase was less prominent for middle-aged and older adults. This could signify a plateau effect of theta power in which a saturation of mental resources is reached, leading to an increased dual-task cost. Therefore, reducing driver task de-mands by limiting the need for motor control processing, e.g., by switching to automatic gear shifting, could be beneficial for driving safety.},

For example, when stimulus-action mappings vary across time or context, the brain may learn two or more stimulus-action mappings in separate modules, and additionally (at a hierarchically higher level) learn to appropriately switch between those modules. However, how the brain mechanistically coordinates neural communication to implement such hierarchical learning remains unknown. Therefore, the current study tests a recent computational model that proposed how midfrontal theta oscillations implement such hierarchical learning via the principle of binding by synchrony (Sync model). More specifically, the Sync model uses bursts at theta frequency to flexibly bind appropriate task modules by synchrony. The 64-channel EEG signal was recorded while 27 human subjects (female: 21, male: 6) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task. In line with the Sync model, postfeedback theta power showed a linear relationship with negative prediction errors, but not with positive prediction errors. This relationship was especially pronounced for subjects with better behavioral fit (measured via Akaike information criterion) of the Sync model. Also consistent with Sync model simulations, theta phase-coupling between midfrontal electrodes and temporoparietal electrodes was stronger after negative feedback. Our data suggest that the brain uses theta power and synchronization for flexibly switching between task rule modules, as is useful, for example, when multiple stimulus action mappings must be retained and used.},
