# Mind the Sleep

Sleep plays a vital role in daily functioning and helps protect against both physical and psychological health issues. We want to learn more about how everyday sleep habits influence mood and cognition, and how these patterns may be linked to symptoms of depression.

This is the project I will be writing my master thesis in cognitive neuroscience on.
