## Mind the sleep is a multimodal, longitudinal study with a rich dataset.

By making a simple relational database we can structure our data to ease the workflow in different parts of the project.

The structure folder contains an entity-relationship diagram to show the structure of the database. The test_participant-file contains a test of the structure for a single participant, and the database.sqlite contains a simple database with metadata, longitudinal structure and derived measures from the data.
